<ul>

<li><div class='banner'><div class='year'>1791</div></div>
<h4>In response to France’s Declaration on the Rights of Man, Olympe de Gouges writes the ‘Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen’</h4>
<p>“Article 1: Woman is born free and remains the equal of man in rights. Social distinctions can only be founded on a common utility.”</p>
</li>


<li><div class='banner'><div class='year'>1792</div></div>
<h4>Mary Wollstonecraft publishes ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Woman’</h4>
<p>“…if they be really capable of acting like rational creatures, let them not be treated like slaves; or, like the brutes who are dependent on the reason of man, when they associate with him; but cultivate their minds, give them the salutary sublime curb of principle, and let them attain conscious dignity by feeling themselves only dependent on God.”</p>
</li>

<li><div class='banner'><div class='year'>1878</div></div>
<h4>Frances Power Cobbe publishes ‘Wife Torture in England,’ to support a new law that would expand legal options available to survivors of domestic violence</h4>

<h4>The first International Congress on Women’s Rights is held in Paris, France</h4>
<p>"Last evening a gentleman who seemed a bit sceptical about the advantages of our Congress asked me, ‘Well, Madame, what great truth have you proclaimed to the world?' I replied to him, ‘Monsieur, we have proclaimed that woman is a human being.' He laughed. ‘But, Madame, that is a platitude.' So it is; but when this platitude, which everyone accepts with a smile when it is merely a question of words, is recognised by human laws, the face of the world will be transformed. Certainly, then, there would be no need for us to assemble in congress to demand the rights of woman." <em>Emily Venturi</em> </p>
