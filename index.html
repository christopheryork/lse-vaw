</li>

<li><div class='banner'><div class='year'>1792</div></div>
<h4>Mary Wollstonecraft publishes ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Woman’</h4>
<p>“It is time to effect a revolution in female manners - time to restore to them their lost dignity - and make them, as a part of the human species, labour by reforming themselves to reform the world. It is time to separate unchangeable morals from local manners.”</p>
</li>

<li><div class='banner'><div class='year'>1792</div></div>
<h4>Mary Wollstonecraft publishes ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Woman’</h4>
<p>“…if they be really capable of acting like rational creatures, let them not be treated like slaves; or, like the brutes who are dependent on the reason of man, when they associate with him; but cultivate their minds, give them the salutary sublime curb of principle, and let them attain conscious dignity by feeling themselves only dependent on God.”</p>

I replied to him, ‘Monsieur, we have proclaimed that woman is a human being.' He laughed. ‘But, Madame, that is a platitude.' So it is; but when this platitude, which everyone accepts with a smile when it is merely a question of words, is recognised by human laws, the face of the world will be transformed. Certainly, then, there would be no need for us to assemble in congress to demand the rights of woman."<span class='attribution'>Emily Venturi</span> </p>
